## Proposal

1) Cyber Sleuth's Necronomicon

A companion app for the video game "Digimon Story Cyber Sleuth".

It can be used to quickly reference back to and navigate the complicated interconnected webs that are digivolution trees.

Users can search for a specific digimon they want by name and filter their search by stage, type, attribute, etc. Users will be able to easily and quickly navigate visual representations of that digimon's digivolution line to learn how to evolve to it. They can also preview information such as the digimon's type, attribute, and skill. They can also easily navigate to its Digimon Fandom wiki page to learn more about it.

2) API's used:

Digimon Story Cyber Sleuth API - https://github.com/SirAirdude/GA-Project-2-DSCS-API

Used to get information about a digimon related to the game (digivolution line, attribute, skill, etc.).

MediaWiki API - https://digimon.fandom.com/api.php

Used to reliably obtain data such as images of a digimon from its wiki Fandom page.

Used to get links to that digimon's article for the user to easily navigate there. 

4) I will be working solo.
